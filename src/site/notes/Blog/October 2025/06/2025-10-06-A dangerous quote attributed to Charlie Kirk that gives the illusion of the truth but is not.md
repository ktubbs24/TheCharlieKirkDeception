# 2025-10-06-A dangerous quote attributed to Charlie Kirk that gives the illusion of the truth but is not

[[üëã Welcome\|home]]

False!

Whether Charlie said this or not‚Ä¶

Jesus is the Truth regardless of how deluded people will be. The only ‚Äúmy truth‚Äù that exists is ‚Äúmy preference‚Äù which comes AFTER Jesus, not before.

This is only the beginning of exposing catchphrases, quotes, speeches that Charlie and many people were out here preaching. There is good knowledge present in what he said and bad knowledge present in what he said. Just like how God warned Adam the Garden of Eden: "All the trees of the garden you may freely eat, but do not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for the day that you eat of it, you will surely die." Phrases like this come from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Let me explain.

When Jesus is speaking through you, you're not going to be speaking crap like this post just implied because this is something directly that Satan would say. Satan out here is lying, saying there is no truth, and that's how Satan speaks. The first part of this quote is to hook you so that you can eat the rest of this quote which is the full lie.

And what's even more dangerous is looking at this with a spiritual lens. This quote implies that human beings who think that they can define truth would be the reason for why truth would not exist, which is a lie. Another issue is that Satan speaks heavily, starting a lot of his statements with hypotheticals using "if". Just as he was tempting Jesus in the wilderness. When he was lying about Jesus, saying "If you are the son of God," and Jesus allowed us to see this to see how Satan's tactics are. When you speak in hypotheticals, you're actually in a very dangerous position in many cases, talking about non-realities. The non-reality in this quote is the phrase "in part if everybody has their own truth" because that statement already started off with a false premise. But it's coming off as a premise that is a statement rooted in the truth, so then the rest of the statement is going to be believed to be the truth. This is why God warns that the serpent is the most sneaky and subtle of all the beasts of the field.

This is the why God says man‚Äôs philosophies is foolishness to Him and warns to not be fooled by vain speech like this. At first it seems right but that‚Äôs how sneaky the devil is with catch phrases and people eat it right up when they don‚Äôt practice discernment to test every spirit to see if it has come from God. MANY of the things he and the ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù apologetic debates preach is that 99% illusion of the truth that‚Äôs so close the truth and still not it and trap MANY who are used to the more overt lies out there‚Ä¶.

I mean, sadly, the person who even posted this lied saying this is the truth. Do y'all see how the devil is working out here?

Colossians 2:8-10 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:
